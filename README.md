## Project 8: Mini Calendar

This is a project for those who have a hard time celebrating their 30th birthday. 
when you enter your age in the upper box, the program will tell you how old you actually are.
So, if you enter 30, the program will tell you that your life has just begun.
If it is under 30, the program will calculate how many years from now you will be born and should start taking life seriously.
